## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently a student at Missouri University of Science and Technology obtaining a bachelors degree in computer science. 
I was an officer in ACM Game where I was the web lead but really only begun to dip my feet into web design. In January 2022, the members of 
ACM Game decided to create a new club, called Appilied computing, where I am a project lead on creating a website. Honestly I have a long way to 
go before I understand web design fully but I am making progress never the less. Applied comuting will also let me participate in other kinds of projects.
Currently our club is looking for some way to get a database up and running without spending money by using the resources provided by campus. I will link a repo whenever the project is actually complete.
